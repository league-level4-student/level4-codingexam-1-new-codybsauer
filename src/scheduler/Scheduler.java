/*
 * Objective: Create a weekly scheduling application.
 * 
 * You may create any additional enums, classes, methods or variables needed
 * to accomplish the requirements below:
 * 
 * - You should use an array filled with enums for the days of the week and each
 *   enum should contain a LinkedList of events that include a time and what is 
 *   happening at the event.
 * 
 * - The user should be able to to interact with your application through the
 *   console and have the option to add events, view events or remove events by
 *   day.
 *   
 * - Each day's events should be sorted by chronological order(Hint: use the 
 *   properties of LinkedLists to place the event in the right spot rather than 
 *   try to sort it afterwards).
 *  
 * - If the user tries to add an event on the same day and time as another event
 *   throw a SchedulingConflictException(created by you) that tells the user
 *   they tried to double book a time slot.
